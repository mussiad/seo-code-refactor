Let's make the code for the webpage smarter and more efficient. 

## User Story 
<br>AS A marketing agency<br>
<br>I WANT a codebase that follows accessability standards<br>
<br>SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines<br>

## Acceptance Criteria
<br>GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
<br>WHEN I view the source code<br>
<br>THEN I find semantic HTML elements<br>
<br>WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements<br> 
<br>THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning<br> 
<br>WHEN I view the icon and image elements<br> 
<br>THEN I find accessible alt attributes <br> 
<br>WHEN I view the heading attributes<br> 
<br>THEN they fall in sequential order<br> 
<br>WHEN I view the title element<br> 
<br>THEN I find a concise, descriptive title<br>
